# RGRec
Rule-Guided Graph Neural Networks for Recommender Systems, ISWC 2020

### Some explanations

* First, running pra_model.py to get the pre-trained weights of rules.
* auc_f1_main.py is used to get the AUC and F1-Score of our model.
* hit_ndcg_main.py is used to get His@k and NDCG@k of our model.
* The paper was accepted after I graduated from Nanjing University, so I only have time to format the codes and datasets at weekends, the projects only have movielens-1M data now, other datasets can be downloaded [here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AqA_HIF7WyFosB3mBny-Zda23ZL3?e=GfCIOv), but I have not formatted them yet, some data is missing, I need time to find them. If you have some questions, please contact [me](https://github.com/xzlyu), I will reply if I have time and energy.
* During the construction of the models, I learned a lot from [KGCN](https://github.com/hwwang55/KGCN), it is an honor for me to know this project, thanks for your inspiration.
* Finally, what a long goodbye, farewell to NJU.
